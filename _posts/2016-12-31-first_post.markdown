Hi everybody!
Partially as a little challenge to myself, partially for expiriense in English writing (I'm a native Russian) I started a blog today.
I will be using [Jekyll][jekyll] for static blog, and [GitHub][github-pages] for hosting. The markdown syntax is totally new to me, so as english writing so many mistakes is on its way!
Soon I'll add [Disqus][disqus] for comments, and first little project is coming. 

Happy New Year!!!
